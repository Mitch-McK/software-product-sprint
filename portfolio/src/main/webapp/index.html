        <p>Welcome to my website! As with many personal websites, this one is being created in service to a learning experience.</p>
        <p>Feel free to stick around, feel free to bounce when your interest dissipates.</p>
        <p>I'm currently a program manager at Google (almost 7 years a Googler as of July 2021!).</p>
        <p>I truly believe in the transformative power of education and the judicious use of technology to accelerate learning.</p>
      <h2>What have I done?</h2>
        <p>Great question. Here are a few thoughts:</p>

            <li>Overhaul of onboarding efforts</li>
            <li>Management of regional training programs</li>
            <li>Focus on building applied computing programs with universities</li>
        </ul>
